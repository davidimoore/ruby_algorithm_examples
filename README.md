##Asymptotic Notation

- Big 0 Notation - Represents the worst case scenario time required to accomplish a task 
- Example counting the number of characters in a string
    - O(n) - Counting the characters one by one. 
    The time it takes will change with n or t the length of the string
    - O(1) - Storing the string in a variable and calling a length method. The size of the string wouldn't affect the time. 
    Only the time of the method length which is assumed to be a constant amount of time. 
    - 0(n^2) - The time required increases exponentially  
    - 0(log n) - Example binary search
